(Ok, numerical polynomials are not part of that\u2014I just remember Peter May talking about them. But I hope the article grows!) \n\n I've thought a lot more about dicyclic groups and understand the connection to pin groups much better, so I'll shortly (tomorrow, I plan) write up the connections (and the center of the pin groups). \n\n Thanks again for the support!",

We can change the language to indicate that the data was collected in New South Wales, not world-wide, although I don't think that this will change the meaning of the language significantly.  NSW seems to be one of the primary places where the breed is established, so a slight change to current wording should suffice.  The second and third bullets are less clear.  Why does it matter that the data is a few years old, especially since the dates of the studies are clearly listed in the article?  Also, if Canis can support claims that RS references in the article contain mistakes, he/she should post other RS references explaining these errors.  Finally, if Canis believes that I have edited incorrectly, I would ask that he/she posts diffs showing my bad behavior and explaining exactly what I have done wrong.  I have no bias in this matter, unlike editors heavily involved in dog breeding and related fields, and everything I am doing on this I article is being done to preserve the article's integrity and to improve Wikipedia.

The guy who spends all his money on a better computer and multiple anime figures to litter his walls and shelves). \n \n I do not come here to listen to how and your girlfriend had a tiff and you want help getting back together. \n I do not come here to listen to your preaching about how easy it is to lead a normal life. \n I do not come here to AIM or MSN or otherwise 'chat' with you. \n I do not come here to listen to your disgusting drivel about how you spend time everyday watching anime with your girlfriend and need a recommendation for another. \n \n If I wanted any of that shit, I'd go to Lake Howell, or Winter Springs, or Seminole. \n \n No, I come here to look at pathetic losers post their fantasies about dating their 2D lover. \n I come here to see pedophiles exchange erotica involving underaged minors. \n I come here to watch stormfront refugees fabricate various 'evidence' about how other races are inferior to whites. \n I come here to view the tips and stories given by crackheads addicted to oxy. \n I come here to revel in the dirt of humanity so that I can feel at home. \n \n I've already done as best as I possibly can to filter shit out. I can ignore individual words, I can ignore conversations, and various other annoyances taken care of, but it doesn't help nowadays. \n If I wanted normal, I'd go somewhere else. \n But you do not understand this desire, and so will respond with \"\"LULCROOMSIZPRIVATESCHOOL\"\" or some other nonsense rather than actually argue for your staying here. \n \n Fucking normals. \n\n  \n\n No, seriously, what's with the influx of normals recently? Everything was nice and good a few months ago, but since about 6 months ago the school has gone straight to shit. Not even \"\"afterschool Crooms\"\" is safe now.  \n \n Are we getting invaded? I don't want to believe that Crooms has fallen this low. The people in this class and many others look like something out of fucking Seminole. \n \n I'm actually convinced 95% of the people in this class are some clique trying to troll us. It's fucking impossible that there are so many normals actively conversing in this class. It's insane. \n You waltz in, completely disregard the established school culture, do whatever the fuck you want, call whomever you disagree with \"\"gay,\"\" and you say you are not being selfish? Just kill yourself. The human race can do without people like you. \n \n\n I actually worried about this school\u2019s quality. Have you been to any afterschool clubs recently? How about that Gamer\u2019s Club? They are nothing but Facebook-tier normals. Can you imagine what would happen if those people get used to this school? \n I mean, normals have always been here, but the thing now is that no one says anything. \n Dozens of conversations are filled with: \n >\"\"my friends\"\" \n >emoticon users \n >\"\"why are you so mean?\"\" \n >\"\"gosh, stop trying to fit in\"\" \n >exclamation marks  \n >\"\"dude, you should get out more\"\" \n >\"\"so I and my friend\"\" \n >\"\"this is no sad c\"\" \n >\"\"lol yeah\"\" \n >\"\"did you see the new update on facebook? i'm so fucking hype!!!\"\" \n \n And so on. It's sickening \n\n \n\n well, well, well, what have we here another faggot normal (most likely seminole) shitting up the place with his Facebook faggotry. you picked the wrong day to fuck around, asshole. i've just texted the a guidance (we're friends out of school) about this conversation, so he'll be here shortly to deal with the matter, and most likely hand out some sorely needed suspensions. i'm also going to report the conversation (for safe measure), as well as alert the other admins in the guidance office. and just in case you wanna try and pull a fast one, i'm recording the entire conversation for additional proof and e-mailing the super intendant about the matter personally. i'm tired of you stupid fucking dick sniffers pressing out whatever lolrandom faggot shit you want in the fucking tech school. it's time for you assholes to get a reality check, because this shit won't fly for much longer. prepare your anus, you 500 pound pile of shit. your days are fucking numbered \n\n  \n \n You are so visibly upset, that you need to create shit-talk in our glorious school in an attempt to raise your self worth. \n \n Come at me you plebian. I am the fucking pinnacle of man, both body and mind. I will attend an Ivy league university, completely payed off by scholarships, with the leftover money used to buy myself a luxury vehicle.

As the Wiki entry for Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles states: \n\n  \n [The Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart] comprises 25 positions that represent songs that are close to charting on the main singles chart, the Billboard Hot 100, acting as an extension to Hot 100. Many times, singles halt their progress at this chart, and never debut on the Hot 100. For example, Kelly Clarkson's \"\"The Trouble with Love Is\"\" stayed at #101 and never went any higher. Also, more noticeable examples are Pet Shop Boys's \"\"Can You Forgive Her?\"\", \"\"Go West\"\", \"\"Before\"\", \"\"Somewhere\"\" and George Clinton's \"\"Atomic Dog\"\", which halted their progress in #101, #106, #107, #125 and #109 respectively, never to appear again in the chart. \n\n  \n On the 09/22/07 Billboard chart, \"\"Everything's Magic\"\" occupied the 11th position on the Bubbling Under chart. That means the song's peak to-date is #111 overall, not #11. I hope this clears up any confusion. \n\n  \"",

I also like how you got so upset that your minor incident was not going to be included that went ahead and removed the incidents that the Irish aviation authorities labeled as serious incidents and had been in the article for a few years. Harry do wiki a favor and stay away from aviation articles, you obviously have the same insight into aviation as a two year old has into biology. Do me a favor, since this is two personal attacks in 24hrs, PLEASE permanently block me so I don't waste anymore of my time on this excuse of an encyclopedia.
